Description: \code{seqArchR} enables unsupervised discovery of _de novo_ clusters 
    with characteristic sequence architectures characterized by 
    position-specific motifs or composition of stretches of nucleotides, 
    e.g., CG-richness. \code{seqArchR} does _not_ require any specifications 
    w.r.t. the number of clusters, the length of any individual motifs, or 
    the distance between motifs if and when they occur in pairs/groups; it 
    directly detects them from the data. \code{seqArchR} uses non-negative 
    matrix factorization (NMF) as its backbone, and employs a chunking-based 
    iterative procedure that enables processing of large sequence collections 
    efficiently. Wrapper functions are provided for visualizing cluster 
    architectures as sequence logos.
